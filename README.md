# Platform Science Code Exercise

Welcome to my solution for the Platform Science Code Exercise!

## Problem Description

The sales team has just struck a deal with Acme Inc to become the exclusive provider for routing their product shipments via 3rd party trucking fleets. The catch is that we can only route one shipment to one driver per day.

Each day we get the list of shipment destinations that are available for us to offer to drivers in our network. Fortunately, our team of highly trained data scientists has developed a mathematical model for determining which drivers are best suited to deliver each shipment.

With that hard work done, now all we have to do is implement a program that assigns each shipment destination to a given driver while maximizing the total suitability of all shipments to all drivers.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/superfsdev/Platform-science-exercise.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Platform-science-exercise

4. Place the input files `drivers.txt` and `shipments.txt` in the root directory of the project.

5. Run the main script:

6. The program will calculate the suitability scores and assign shipment destinations to drivers while maximizing the total suitability.

## Input Files

- `drivers.txt`: This file should contain the names of the drivers, one name per line.

- `shipments.txt`: This file should contain the street addresses of the shipment destinations, one address per line.
